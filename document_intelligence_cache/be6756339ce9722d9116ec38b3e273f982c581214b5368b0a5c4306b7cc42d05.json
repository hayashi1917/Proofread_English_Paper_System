Comparisons\nDemonstrative pronouns are often used to complete comparisons (see\nsection 1.3.4):\nPoor\nThe pressures on the left dry-power nozzle are lower\nthan the right afterburning-power nozzle.\nBetter\nThe pressures on the left dry-power nozzle are lower\nthan those on the right afterburning-power nozzle.\nOr\nThe pressures are lower on the left dry-power nozzle\nthan on the right afterburning-power nozzle.\nIf the antecedent of the demonstrative pronoun is obscure, reword the\nsentence or repeat the subject of comparison.\nPoor\nThe axial force on the left dry-power nozzle in the\npresence of a right afterburning-power nozzle was lower\nthan that in the presence of a right dry-power nozzle.\nBetter\nThe axial force on the left dry-power nozzle was lower in\nthe presence of a right afterburning-power nozzle than\nin the presence of a right dry-power nozzle.\nOmission of standard of comparison\nUnless the standard of comparison is clear, comparisons are meaningless:\nPoor\nAt the higher angles of attack, flow separation is exten-\nsive.\nBetter\nAt high angles of attack, flow separation is extensive.\nPoor\nHigher strength martensitic steels are attractive candi-\ndate cryogenic materials.\nBetter\nMartensitic steels, which are stronger than ferritic\nsteels, are attractive candidate cryogenic materials.\n2.5.3. Comparison\nConstructions\nSo far in this section, only comparison constructions involving than have\nbeen discussed. Several other constructions may be used, or misused, to\nexpress comparisons.\nCompare with\nThe verb compare takes either to or with, depending on meaning.\nBernstein (1981), explains the use of with quite clearly: \"When the purpose\nis to place one thing side by side with another, to examine their differences\nor their similarities, use with.\" In technical writing, do comparisons ever\nhave any other purpose?\nThe participle compared with is often used (sometimes in a dangling\nconstruction) when another construction would be better:\nPoor\nThe grain-refined material was much tougher compared\nwith the control material.\n41",
