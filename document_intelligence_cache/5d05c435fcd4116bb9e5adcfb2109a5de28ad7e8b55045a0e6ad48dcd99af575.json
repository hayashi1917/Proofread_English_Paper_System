Comma\n· Antithetical elements\nIn winter, clouds near the tropopause are associated with negative\nvorticity, not with positive vorticity as most meteorologists are accustomed\nto believing.\n· Interruptive words or phrases\nFor 33-um-diameter particles, for example, partial loss of laminar flow is\npredicted for large number densities.\nPhrases with common termination\nEnclose by commas a phrase with termination that also reads back to\na previous phrase:\nAn aircraft flying through clouds will lose a significant portion, if not all,\nof its laminar flow.\nThe particle-concentration data have nearly the same latitudinal, but\na significantly different seasonal, distribution from that of the cloud-\nencounter data.\nNominative absolute\nA nominative absolute phrase (that is, a noun with no grammatical\nfunction in the sentence modified by a participle) is nonrestrictive and thus\nis enclosed by commas:\nMost confidence may be placed in the statistics for the 30°N to 60ºN\nlatitude band, more data having been taken at these latitudes.\n3.5.3. Conventional\nUses of\nthe Comma\nThe following conventional uses of the comma should be considered enclosure\nrather than separation:\n· Dates\nThe study was conducted from January 15, 1975, to\nFebruary 1, 1979, aboard commercial airliners.\nBut\nThe study was conducted from January 1975 to Febru-\nary 1979 aboard commercial airliners.\n· Geographical names and addresses\nThese instruments were carried on commercial airliners en route from\nChicago, Illinois, to London, England.\nThe computer program is available from COSMIC, 112 Barrow Hall,\nUniversity of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602.\n59",
