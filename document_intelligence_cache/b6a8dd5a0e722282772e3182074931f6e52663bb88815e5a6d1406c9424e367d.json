      "content": "Section 4.4. Acronyms and Abbreviations\n. In a hyphenated phrase of three or more words, the first element and other\nelements that are principal words are capitalized (Skillin et al. 1974):\nDrag-Due-to-Lift Measurements\nfor a High-Speed Fighter\n. If a normally lowercase short word is used parallel with a capitalized word\nof like significance, the short word should be capitalized:\nCarbon-Fiber Risk In and Around Airports\n· Capitalize the infinitive to (note that some authorities, for example, Chicago\nPress 1982, recommend lowercase for the infinitive):\nGrain-Refining Heat Treatments To Improve\nCryogenic Toughness of High-Strength Steels\nGrain-Refining Heat Treatments\nResulting in Improvements to Cryogenic\nToughness of High-Strength Steels\n. Normally lowercase abbreviations should always be left lowercase, particu-\nlarly abbreviations for units of measure:\nToughness of 1-ft by 1.5-ft Specimens\nToughness of 0.5-cm-Thick Specimens\nNoise Exposure From 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.\nBut\nFlow Visualization in the 0.3-Meter\nTransonic Cryogenic Tunnel\n· Headline style capitalization is used for proper nouns (see section 4.5).\nAs a matter of preferred style, the following elements are capitalized in\nheadline style in Langley reports:\n· Displayed (not run-in) headings\n· Table titles:\nTable IV. Test Results for HP-9-4-20\nTable IV. Concluded\n4.4. Acronyms and\nAbbreviations\nBefore beginning a discussion of capitalization of abbreviations and\nacronyms, the two must be clearly distinguished. An abbreviation is a\nshortened version of a word or phrase and is often followed by a period, for\nexample, c.o.d., ft-lb, St., or publ. Abbreviations usually have become stan-\ndard so that their form can be looked up in a reference book. Acronyms,\non the other hand, are \"words formed from the initial letters of succes-\nsive parts of a term\" (Skillin et al. 1974), for example, NASA, NASTRAN,\nSTIF, NASP. They never contain periods and are often not standard, so\nthat definition is required.\n85",
