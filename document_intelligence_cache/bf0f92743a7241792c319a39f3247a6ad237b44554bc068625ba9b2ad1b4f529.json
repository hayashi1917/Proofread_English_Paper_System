Punctuation\nCompound nouns\nMost permanent prepositional-phrase compound nouns are hyphen-\nated, and most other permanent compound nouns are solid:\nright-of-way\nmother-in-law\nworkbench\ncupboard\nSome noun phrases are in the process of becoming permanent com-\npounds; but although they are defined in the dictionary, they are not yet\nhyphenated. For example, Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary lists\nright-of-way, n. & adj.\nBut\nstate of the art, n .; state-of-the-art, adj.\nThe dictionary is the best source for hyphenation and spelling of permanent\ncompound nouns.\nFormation of a temporary compound noun with a hyphen is appropriate\nwhen a combination of several nouns is one entity:\nwing-body\nwriter-editor\nCompound verbs\nHyphenate an active compound verb derived from a noun form consist-\ning of separate words:\nLangley flight-tested that configuration.\nTo cross-brace such a structure is impossible.\nBut the passive verb form need not be hyphenated:\nThat configuration was flight tested.\nSuch a structure could not be cross braced.\nUnit modifiers\nMost authorities (for example, Bernstein 1981 and G.P.O. 1984) advo-\ncate hyphenating unit modifiers only when necessary to avoid ambiguity.\nSee section 1.5.2; the guidelines for hyphenation are repeated here:\n. A unit modifier should not be hyphenated\n· When the unit modifier is a predicate adjective: The aircraft was flight\ntested.\nNote that an adjective that is hyphenated in the dictionary is hyphen-\nated as a predicate adjective (IRS 1962): The method is well-known.\n66",
