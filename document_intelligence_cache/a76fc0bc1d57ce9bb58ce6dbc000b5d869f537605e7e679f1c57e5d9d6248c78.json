Headline Style\nCapitalization\nHeadline style calls for all principal words to be capitalized (also called caps\n& lc). Unfortunately authorities differ widely on what words are principal.\nLangley rules for headline style capitalization are based on the G.P.O. (1984)\nand are as follows:\n. Do not capitalize the articles a, an, and the; the prepositions or adverbs\nat, by, for, of, in, up, on, and to; and the conjunctions and, as, but, if, or,\nand nor. In effect, this rule means that words of four or more letters are\nconsidered principal words and are capitalized.\n· Capitalize the first and last words:\nProcedure After All Questionnaires Are In\n. Capitalize both elements of a two-element hyphenated compound word\nexcept the second element of a compound numeral:\nApplication of the Pin Level Stuck-At\nFault Model to VLSI Circuits\nVapor-Screen Systems for In-Flight Flow Visualization\nEvaluation of Twenty-one\nHigh-Resolution Graphics Work Stations\n84",
