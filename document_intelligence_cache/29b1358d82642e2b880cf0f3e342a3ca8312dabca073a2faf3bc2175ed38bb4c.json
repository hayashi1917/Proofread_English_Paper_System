      "content": "Section 2.2. Subjects and Verbs\nRowland's, indirect constructions can be ambiguous. Such idioms as \"it is\nknown\" or \"it is believed\" indicate general knowledge or belief:\nIt is believed that this is a nozzle-aspect-ratio effect.\nIn most technical writing, these constructions refer to the author's belief or\nknowledge. Perhaps a personal pronoun is appropriate (see section 1.3.2):\nWe believe that this back pressure increase is a nozzle-aspect-ratio effect.\nNote the change in the subordinate clause of this sentence. Demon-\nstrative pronouns (this, these, that, or those used as nouns) with \"broad\nreference\" (Ebbitt and Ebbitt 1982) can be undesirable and ungrammatical\nwhen their antecedent is not clear (see section 1.3.1):\nPoor\nMass flow rate increased in the cove. This resulted in\nincreased cove gas temperature.\nBetter\nThe increasing mass flow rate in the cove increased cove\ngas temperature.\nPlease do not insert stock abstract words such as result, effect, or apparatus\nafter every demonstrative pronoun. Remember that the subject of a\nsentence (or clause) should be clear and concrete and should relate to\nprevious ideas.\n2.2.2. Make Verbs\nVigorous\nThe only words capable of expressing action are verbs and their derivatives.\nInvigorating verbs will make writing more concise and easier to read.\nIn the following phrases, the action of the verb reduce is progressively\ndeemphasized:\nActive voice\nIf we reduce drag, ...\nPassive voice\nIf drag is reduced, ...\nVerbal\nWith reduced drag, ...\nVerb-derived noun\nWith reduction of drag, ...\nWeak verbs\nOne of the most common causes of weak verbs has already been\ndiscussed; when the real verb of a sentence becomes the subject, a weaker\nverb must be substituted:\nPoor\nA comparison of lift coefficients for the two configura-\ntions is presented in table II.\nBetter\nLift coefficients for the two configurations are compared\nin table II.\n29",
