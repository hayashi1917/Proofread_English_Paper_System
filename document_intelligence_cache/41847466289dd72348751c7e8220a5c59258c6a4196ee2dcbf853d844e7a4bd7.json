Proper Nouns and Adjectives\n· In general, proper nouns and derivatives of proper nouns used in a proper\nsense are capitalized:\nItaly\nItalian\nRome\nRoman (of Rome)\nAlps\nAlpine\nNewton\nNewtonian\n. However, derivatives of proper nouns that have acquired an independent\nmeaning are not capitalized:\nroman (numeral)\npascal (the unit)\nitalicize\npasteurize\n\"Defining the distinction between proper adjectives with a proper meaning\nand derivatives ... with a common meaning is sometimes difficult\" (Skillin\net al. 1974):\nCoulomb's Law\n20 coulombs\nG. B. Venturi\nventuri tube\nGauss' equation\nGaussian distribution\nEuclidean algorithm\neuclidean geometry\nThe dictionary is a good reference for guidance in this matter, but is\nnot always definitive. For example, in Webster's Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary, euclidean geometry has the label \"often cap E,\" which means\nthat \"it is as acceptable with an uppercase initial as it is with one in\nlowercase.\" Thus, usage in the given field and author preference should\nprevail.\n· A common noun in a proper name is capitalized, but not when used alone:\nThe experimental investigation was conducted in the Langley 16-Foot\nTransonic Tunnel. This single-return tunnel has continuous air exchange.\nHowever, when a common noun alone becomes a well-known short form for\nthe proper name, it is capitalized:\nUnited States, the States\nU.S. Army, the Army\nPresident of the United States, the President\n· The plural form in a proper name is capitalized (G.P.O. 1984):\nSeventh and Ninth Streets\nLakes Erie and Ontario\nLangley 16-Foot and 30- by 60-Foot Tunnels\n87",
