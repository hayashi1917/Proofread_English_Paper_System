Squinting\nAdverbs\nAn adverb \"squints\" when it is not clear whether it modifies the preceding\nor the following words:\nSquinting\nAlthough the operator eventually replaced the thermo-\ncouple, during that test, the temperature measurements\nwere inconsistent.\nEither\nAlthough during that test, the operator eventually re-\nplaced the thermocouple, the temperature measure-\nments were inconsistent.\nOr\nAlthough the operator eventually replaced the thermo-\ncouple, the temperature measurements were inconsis-\ntent during that test.\n1.6.3. Split Infinitives\nDespite the fact that split infinitives have usually been proscribed in formal\nwriting, most, if not all, grammar authorities recommend splitting an\ninfinitive to avoid ambiguity or awkwardness. In particular, do not place\nan adverb before or after an infinitive if in that position the adverb might\nappear to modify a word other than the infinitive:\nSplit\nHe agreed to immediately recalibrate the surface pres-\nsure instrumentation on the wing.\nSquinting\nHe agreed immediately to recalibrate the surface pres-\nsure instrumentation on the wing.\nAwkward\nHe agreed to recalibrate immediately the surface pres-\nsure instrumentation on the wing.\nSplit\nThe flow at 8 = 0° was the first to completely establish\nitself over the wing.\nAwkward\nThe flow at 8 = 0° was the first completely to establish\nitself over the wing.\nSquinting\nThe flow at 8 = 0° was the first to establish itself\ncompletely over the wing.\n· Avoid splitting an infinitive with a phrasal adverb. Such split infinitives are\nusually awkward.\n1.7. Prepositions\nPrepositions are handy little words that connect a phrase to a sentence and\n'at the same time impart meaning. Prepositional phrases can function as\nadjectives, adverbs, or nouns.\nWhen prepositions are used redundantly or unnecessarily, they should\nbe deleted for the sake of brevity (see section 2.4.1).\n17",
