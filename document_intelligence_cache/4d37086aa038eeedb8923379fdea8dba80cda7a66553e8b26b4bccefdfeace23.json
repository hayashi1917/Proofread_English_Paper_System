To explain the wide variation in degradation rate\nfor various composite matrixes\n2.4. Brevity and\nConciseness\nTechnical writing should be concise, free of redundancy and unnecessary\ndetail. Minimizing the number of words to achieve brevity does not\nnecessarily result in conciseness and may destroy the emphasis, the pace,\nand perhaps the meaning of a passage. However, wordiness seems to be a\ncommon fault of technical writing, and editors should delete unnecessary or\nredundant words.\n2.4.1. Wordiness\nMany reference books contain sections containing lists of wordy, redundant,\nor trite expressions (for example, Skillin et al. 1974, p. 407ff; and Rowland\n1962, chapter XIV). We suggest that writers and editors occasionally peruse\nsuch lists in order to remain sensitive to unnecessary wordiness. Tichy\nand Fourdrinier (1988) classify seven types of common wordiness and list\nnumerous examples of each:\n· Tautology, the unnecessary repetition of an idea\nac current\n20 sec in duration\nOmit current\nclose proximity\nin the range of 1 to 10\nOmit in duration\nOmit close\nReplace in the range of with from\n· Dilute verbs (see section 2.2.2)\nare found to be in agreement\nUse agree\nanalyses were made\nUse analyze\nmake adjustments to\nUse adjust\ngive consideration to\nUse consider\ntake measurements of\nUse measure\n· Hiccups, superfluous prepositions and adverbs\nof from\nOmit of\ncall for\nUse demand\nenter into\nOmit into\nin between\nOmit in\ninside of\nOmit of\ngo on with\nUse continue\n· Roundabout constructions\nPoor\nThere are three distinct flow characteristics in these\nphotographs.\n35",
