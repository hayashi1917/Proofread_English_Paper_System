Hyphen\n· Use a hyphen to attach a prefix to a proper noun or adjective:\nun-American\nanti-Arab\n· Hyphenate a homograph (a word with two meanings) that might be misun-\nderstood without the hyphen:\nunionized\nun-ionized\nrecover\nre-cover\ncoop\nco-op\nmultiply\nmulti-ply\n. Hyphenate a word that might be misread or difficult to read without the\nhyphen:\nun-uniform\npost-stall\nsub-subcommittee\n. When a vowel would be doubled or a consonant tripled, use the hyphen:\nmicro-organism\nanti-inflation\nNote: the prefixes co, de, pre, pro, and re are printed solid even if a\nvowel will be doubled:\ncooperation\npreexist\n· Use a hyphen to attach a prefix to a hyphenated compound word:\nnon-civil-service position\npseudo-steady-state system\n3.8.3. Suffixes\nHyphens are rarely used to connect a suffix to a word.\n· Use the hyphen to avoid tripling a consonant:\nshell-like\nhull-less\n. Use the hyphen when the suffix like is attached to a proper noun.\n3.8.4. Compound\nWords\nCompound words may be (1) permanent, their form (solid or hyphenated)\nbeing determined by usage and often appearing in dictionaries, or (2) tem-\nporary, being hyphenated. Most permanent compounds tend to become\nsolid (without hyphen) with usage, and most authorities (Bernstein 1981;\nG.P.O. 1984; and Skillin et al. 1974) prefer to avoid forming temporary\ncompounds. Thus, the trend is away from hyphenation.\n65",
