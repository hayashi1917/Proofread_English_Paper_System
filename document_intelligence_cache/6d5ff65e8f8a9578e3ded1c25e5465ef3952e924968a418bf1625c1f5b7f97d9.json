      "content": "Section 3.9. Italics\n3.9.4. Italics for\nSymbology\nMost mathematical symbols and letter symbols representing a physical\nconcept are italic, whether within roman or italic text. Chemical symbols,\ncomputer symbols, and abbreviations are not italic. Symbols representing\nvectors, tensors, and matrices may be set in boldface roman type if available.\nIn typewritten text, we recommend double spacing around symbols to\ndistinguish those that would normally be italic.\n3.9.5. Conventional\nUses for\nItalics\nThere are several items that are italicized by convention:\n· Titles and subtitles of books, reports,5 compilations, newspapers, and\nperiodicals are italicized, but not titles of articles, meeting papers, theses,\npapers in compilations, or patents:\nSlater, Philip N. 1980: Remote Sensing-Optics and Optical Systems.\nAddison-Wesley Publ. Co., Inc.\nElterman, L. 1970: Vertical-Attenuation Model With Eight Surface Me-\nteorological Ranges 2 to 14 Kilometers. AFCRL-70-0200, U.S. Air\nForce, Mar. (Available from DTIC as AD 707 488.)\nBowker, D. E .; Davis, R. E .; Von Ofenheim, W. H. C .; and Myrick,\nD. L. 1983: Estimation of Spectral Reflectance Signatures From\nSpectral Radiance Profiles. Proceedings of the Seventeenth Interna-\ntional Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment, Volume II,\nEnvironmental Research Inst. of Michigan, pp. 795-814.\nAllen, William A .; and Richardson, Arthur J. 1968: Interaction of Light\nWith a Plant Canopy. J. Opt. Soc. America, vol. 58, no. 8, Aug.,\npp. 1923-1928.\nWeidner, Elizabeth H .; and Drummond, J. Philip 1981: A Parametric\nStudy of Staged Fuel Injector Configurations for Scramjet Applica-\ntions. AIAA-81-1468, July.\nNemeth, Michael Paul 1983: Buckling Behavior of Orthotropic Compos-\nite Plates With Centrally Located Cutouts. Ph.D. Diss., Virginia\nPolytechnic Inst. & State Univ., May.\n· Foreign words that will be unfamiliar to readers are italicized, but not\nforeign proper names (Challais-Meudon, Göttingen), foreign currency (lira,\nfranc), foreign titles of documents, or foreign phrases that have been adopted\ninto English (see list of foreign words and phrases, p. 481ff., Skillin et al.\n1974).\n· Biological names of genera, species, and varieties are italicized, but not\nhigher classifications. Refer to CBE (1978) for more complete information.\n5 Most authorities on style do not indicate whether or not to italicize report titles; Tichy\nand Fourdrinier (1988) recommend italics for titles of long reports. We prefer italic report\ntitles.\n69",
