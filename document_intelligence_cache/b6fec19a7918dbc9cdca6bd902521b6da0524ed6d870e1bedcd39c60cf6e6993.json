Possessive Case\nAt Langley, the preferred rules for forming possessives are as follows (G.P.O.\n1984; and Rowland 1962):\n· Form the possessive of a singular or plural noun not ending in s by\nadding 's.\n· Form the possessive of a singular or plural noun ending in s by adding an\napostrophe only:\nSingular\nPlural\nman's\nmen's\nhorse's\nhorses'\nJones'\nJoneses'\n. Form the possessive of a compound noun by adding 's to the end of the\ncompound:\nsister-in-law's home\nJohn Doe, Jr.'s report\npatent counsel's decision\n· Indicate joint possession by adding 's to the last element of a series; indicate\nindividual possession by adding 's to each element:\nWayne and Tom's office (one office)\neditor's, proofreader's, and typist's tasks\nSome authorities (for example, Skillin et al. 1974; and Bernstein 1981)\npartially disagree with the second rule above. They state that the possessive\nof a singular proper noun is formed by adding 's even when the noun ends\nin s (for example, Jones's); however, a triple sibilant is always avoided (for\nexample, Jesus').\n1.2.2. Possessive of\nInanimate\nObjects\nIn the past, the possessive case ('s) was not acceptable for inanimate nouns.\nInstead the preposition of was preferred, that is, strength of the laminate\nrather than laminate's strength.\nExceptions to this rule were inanimate words representing a collection\nof animate beings (for example, company's profits, university's curriculum)\nand words expressing measure or time (for example, 2 hours' work). Current\npractice is to dispense with both the 's and the of (Skillin et al. 1974):\ncompany profits\nuniversity curriculum\nlaminate strength\n2 hours work\n2",
