\section{Introduction}
This is the first sentence of the introduction. This is the second sentence! And this is the third sentence?

The introduction continues with more content. We can test various splitting methods with this document.

\section{Methods}
Our methodology includes several steps. First, we preprocess the data. Then, we apply our algorithm.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Data preprocessing is crucial for good results. We clean the data carefully. Missing values are handled appropriately.

\section{Results}
The results show significant improvements. Our method outperforms baseline approaches. The accuracy increased by 15%.

\section{Conclusion}
This work presents a novel approach. Future research will explore extensions. We believe this method has great potential.
